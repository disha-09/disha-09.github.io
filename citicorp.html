                            <h2>Equities : C10</h2>
							<p>
								I am a part of Equities Middle Office Engineering Team that worked on TRON, a SpringBoot microservice framework, which aimed to ease
								the development and deployment of all the microservices within the Middle Office space. TRON houses various technical functionalities
								with which any microservice can be deployed on ECS within few hours.<br>Below are my contributions to this framework:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Implemented support for Java based web services (gRPC, HTTP) utilizing Docker, containers, Gradle, Git / GitHub, Jenkins 
										and the Atlassian collaboration suite.
									</li>
								</br>
									<li>
										Worked proactively to create Rsocket Spring Boot server-client microservices that communicated using WebSocket messaging protocol for
										streaming messages in the low latency environments. 
									</li>
								</br>
									<li>
										Utilized the certificates provided by VENAFI to set up TLS and mTLS for the microservices based on 
										gRPC as well as HTTP framework which resulted in strong security of these microservices.		
									</li>
								</br>	
									<li>
										Created Docker Base Image, to be used by all the teams in the Middle Office, that included all the common linux utilities
										as well as provided functionalities like booting the microservices, executing shell scripts, sourcing the certificates from VENAFI 
										and support for Autosys jobs.
									</li>
								</br>	
								</ul>
							</p>
                            <h2>Commodities : C09</h2>
                            <p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Implemented the entire backend system using Java, SpringBoot, Spring Data JPA & SQL of the Broker Recon Project 
										from scratch. This project automated the reconciliation of confirmation of the trades sent by Brokers against the trades 
										booked in the Openlink System of CITI.
									</li>
								</br>
									<li>
										Broker Recon Project, which was a failure in 2017, on automation gave 80% success rate for the OTC Trades and 
										70% success rate for the Exchange Trades bringing down the reconciliation time from almost 8-10 hours to approximately 2 hours.  
									</li>
								</br>									
									<li>
										Automated the Zero Touch Deployment in UrbanCodeDeploy and ServiceNow thereby improving the release process for the 
										Straight Through Processing Application. This project reduced the deployment time of the application from 5-6 hours to approximately 20 minutes.
									</li>
								</ul>
